Unconstrained environments include surveillance footage, social media photos and live broadcasts. This type of images and videos include no control over illumination, position, size, occlusion, and facial expressions. Successful facial processing methods for controlled scenarios are unable to pledge with challenging circumstances.</description></item><item><title>AUMPNet: Simultaneous Action Units Detection and Intensity Estimation on Multipose Facial Images Using a Single Convolutional Neural Network</title><link>https://juliocesarbatista.com/posts/aumpnet/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://juliocesarbatista.com/posts/aumpnet/</guid><description>Abstract: This paper presents an unified convolutional neural network (CNN), named AUMPNet, to perform both Action Units (AUs) detection and intensity estimation on facial images with multiple poses. Although there are a variety of methods in the literature designed for facial expression analysis, only few of them can handle head pose variations. Therefore, it is essential to develop new models to work on non-frontal face images, for instance, those obtained from unconstrained environments.</description></item></channel></rss>
